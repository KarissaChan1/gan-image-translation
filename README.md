# gan-image-translation
An exploration of GAN models for brain MRI modality translation (FLAIR to DWI scalars) with custom callbacks:
- pix2pix: [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks (Isola et al, 2018)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004)
- CycleGAN: [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (Zhu et al, 2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8237506)
- UNIT: code modified from Tensorflow implementation by Welander et al. in [Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation on Multi-Contrast MR Images - A Comparison of CycleGAN and UNIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07777)
